## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

During this project, I was able to begin a long-term endeavor that I had been planning for quite some time. **E-Alytics** is the first stat-tracking software tailored to esports, offering insights into player consistency and optimization, allowing players and teams to improve through data analysis of CS2 professional matches. While I had previously used the `awpy` and `DemoParser2` packages to experiment with `.dem` files from CS2 matches, this project allowed me to explore their capabilities more in-depth. I gained a deeper understanding of data manipulation and the full potential these packages offer to those who experiment with them.

I also learned more about **Streamlit** and how to design an application/web program with a focus on user experience. Optimizing the application for users with minimal technical expertise was a particularly rewarding aspect. Combining the interactive features of Streamlit with CS2 parsing tools enabled me to create an accessible platform for analyzing esports data. This project aligns strongly with my career goals, as it allowed me to explore advanced techniques in esports analytics.

With this project, users can focus on specific team matchups, overall performance, or individual player statistics. The interactive visuals and heatmaps provided by Streamlit significantly enhance the analysis experience, and I plan to expand the application to include a broader range of games and analysis features. If I had more time, the first improvement I would make would be addressing the issues caused by uploading multiple matchups, which often leads to errors. I would implement functionality to guide users to select one team or player for focused analysis. 

In future iterations, I aim to integrate APIs such as the Steam API and FaceIT API, enabling users to track their own matches without uploading files. Initially, I wanted to allow users to download and unpack `.dem` files directly within the application, but web scraping limitations due to bot protections prevented this. Expanding into creating custom interactive maps for better visualization of player performance, such as kill and death locations, is another key area of improvement.

The project also revealed the potential for additional customization features. For example, tracking individual player performance alongside team-based analysis would add depth. Other visualizations, such as economy or weapon charts, are features I intend to include in future updates.

Testing this application presented significant challenges, as parsing `.dem` files often takes one to two minutes. When errors arose, troubleshooting became time-intensive, especially with the interactive heatmaps and session state errors caused by data formatting issues. The focus on usability meant that some of the planned web scraping functionality was deprioritized, and while I acknowledge this limitation, I am determined to revisit and improve upon it.

Overall, this project was both challenging and rewarding. It provided valuable insights into the development of esports analytics tools and solidified my interest in this field. Moving forward, I plan to continue refining and expanding **E-Alytics** to make it a robust platform for esports enthusiasts and professionals. The possibilities are nearly endless, and I look forward to exploring them further during the upcoming break.
